        <h2>Adding Features</h2>
        <p>
            Adding new features is much appreciated. Please submit a pull request in order for your
            feature request to be evaluated.<br />
            This works pretty much the same as fixing bugs. First of all you need the repository:
        </p>
        <p>
            <code>
git clone git@github.com:&lt;Your Username>/resolver.git
cd resolver
git remote add upstream git@github.com:pixelpolishers/resolver.git
            </code>
        </p>
        <p>
            Next pull the latest changes. All new features should be based on the latest development
            branch which is called "develop".
        </p>
        <p>
            <code>
git checkout develop
git pull upstream develop
git push origin
            </code>
        </p>
        <p>
            Now create a branch, you will be doing your changes in there:
        </p>
        <p>
            <code>git checkout -b feature/&lt;your feature></code>
        </p>
