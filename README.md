# resolver

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/pixelpolishers/resolver.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/pixelpolishers/resolver)

An open source C++ dependency manager.

## Requirements

To run Resolver, you need to have PHP installed.

## Installation

Download the following files:

- https://pixelpolishers.github.io/resolver/resolver.phar
- https://pixelpolishers.github.io/resolver/resolver.phar.pubkey

You will need to download both files, to the same directory, for the utility to work; additionally, the name of the 
key must not be changed. Once downloaded, make the the PHAR file executable.

**Pro-Tip:** Put both files in a directory that is on your $PATH. Than create the alias *resolver* to the phar so you 
can easily execute it from anywhere on your system.
